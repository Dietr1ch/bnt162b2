** 0.0.0.1a -- 2021-01-01

   Added an incomplete Haskell binary and library for analyzing and rewriting
   RNA sequences.

   Rewriting is hard-coded to maximize Gs and Cs.
   No analysis code available yet.

   I intend to figure out why the rewriting with some fixed "optimal" Codons is
   not enough.
   I'm guessing there's some attempt to introduce variance of the codons
   synonyms to ease gathering the inputs needed for copying them. I'd expect to
   be some local optimization as the copying process seems to be stream-based,
   so in any window of the sequence we wish to avoid needing too many of some
   "build inputs".

** 0.0.0.1 -- 2021-01-01

   First version.
